This package is responsible for the generation of the target system code. This package primarily consists of classes that allow the instantiation of a Target Model.  This model is used by the sibling generator classes to produce the required system.  The Target Model itself is generally platform independent and it is classes derived from the core generator classes that allow for support of different targets.<br><br>

An instance of the Target Model is created and populated by mapping information from the OS Model. During population target type attributes and relationships are calculated, ready for use by a generator
