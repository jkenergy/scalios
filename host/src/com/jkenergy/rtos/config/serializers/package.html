This package contains classes that allow both importation and exportation of information to and from the configuration data models.  An OIL serializer makes use of the parser classes in order to allow importation of OIL. An XML parser (based on a standard DOM API) allows for the importation and exportation of XML format data. At the present time on the JKE specific XML format is supported, future versions however will also include support for the Standard AUTOSAR XML format.
