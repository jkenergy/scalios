This package contains the classes that model the core operating system configuration data. This OS Model is fully independent of any input language (e.g. OIL or XML) and any generated system. The OS Model is in effect the one true representation of operating system configuration data, and is capable of supporting all four conformance classes of an OSEK operating system.
