# Makefile for building test2. See main.c for details of test. This makefile is mostly the same as
# for other tests, but notice that it requires "INCLUDE_HANDLE_NAME_MAP" to be set this way to
# ensure the map is included from the auto-generated C. No API errors are expected so "EXPECTSERRORS"
# is set to indicate this (an API error that results in the error hook being called will cause
# the test to report failure).

INSTALL=../..

-include $(INSTALL)/builds/common/defaults.mf

# The test doesn't expect errors. Keep the error hook in to fail the test if any errors
# occur.
USEERRORHOOK=USEERRORHOOK

# The test requires the startup hook to be enabled so that the sequence of events can be checked

# Brings in standard makefile for building all four library variants of a test (generic
# across all tests).
