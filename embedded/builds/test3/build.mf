# Makefile for building test3. INCLUDE_HANDLE_NAME must be set for this test to link properly.
# The test expects errors to be generated and requires the error hook. EXPECTSERRORS and USEERRORHOOK
# are set appropriately.
#
# test3 checks the API for error returns. It will perform some basic API testing because correctly-formed
# calls should operate correctly.

# This test will generate errors to be handled. EXPECTSERRORS when set ensures the ErrorHook() in the framework
# expects to be called for correct operation (NO_EXPECTSERRORS causes the ErrorHook() to call test_failed() if
# it does get called).
