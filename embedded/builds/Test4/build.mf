# Don't use any hooks: these add too many events and the test buffer isn't big enough for it
# to fit (it currently uses more than 1K RAM to store the events and there is a danger that
# the available RAM isn't enough to run the whole test).

# Enable the error hook so that the test will fail if errors are raised.
